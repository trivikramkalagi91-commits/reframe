## Development Tips

### 1. Next.js Fast Refresh
This project uses Next.js Fast Refresh in development mode. Most changes to React components, hooks, and styles are reflected instantly in the browser without restarting the dev server.

- Component updates appear immediately
- State is often preserved during edits
- Restarting `npm run dev` is usually unnecessary for UI changes

Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh

---

### 2. FFmpeg Module Changes
Changes to `ffmpeg.ts` may not hot-reload correctly because FFmpeg initialization and WebAssembly modules can persist in memory.

If updates are not reflected:

- Perform a full browser page reload
- Clear cached worker instances if necessary
- Restart the development server only when required

FFmpeg WASM reference: https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/overview

---

### 3. Monitor FFmpeg Downloads
FFmpeg WebAssembly assets can be large and may take time to download during development.

Use the browser DevTools **Network** tab to:

- Verify FFmpeg assets are loading correctly
- Inspect caching behavior
- Detect failed `.wasm` or worker requests
- Measure initialization performance

Chrome DevTools: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network

---

### 4. Use React DevTools
Install React DevTools for easier component inspection and debugging.

Helpful for:

- Inspecting component props and state
- Tracing re-renders
- Debugging hooks
- Monitoring React component trees

React DevTools: https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools

---

### 5. Keep Console Open During Development
The browser console provides important runtime diagnostics for:

- FFmpeg initialization issues
- Hydration warnings
- API request failures
- WebAssembly loading errors

Filtering logs by warnings/errors can speed up debugging significantly.

---

### 6. Use Source Maps for Easier Debugging
Development builds include source maps, allowing you to debug original TypeScript/React source files directly from DevTools.

Tips:

- Set breakpoints in source files
- Use async stack traces
- Inspect runtime variables during rendering

JavaScript debugging guide: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript

---

### 7. Watch for Memory Usage
FFmpeg WebAssembly processing can consume significant browser memory during video operations.

Recommendations:

- Close unused tabs while testing
- Refresh the page after heavy processing tasks
- Monitor memory usage in browser performance tools

Performance tools: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance

---

### 8. Verify Environment Variables
After modifying `.env.local`, restart the Next.js development server because environment variables are loaded only during server startup.

Example:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Environment variables guide: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables

**Before claiming an issue:**
1. Check if it already has an assignee — if so, pick a different one
2. Comment `/assign` on the issue to claim it instantly via our bot
3. If an issue has been idle and unassigned for a while, it's fair game

---

## 🙋 Claiming Issues

We use a bot to automatically manage issue assignments. Here's how it works:

### Claiming an Issue
Comment `/assign` on any open issue to claim it:
- The bot will assign it to you instantly
- You have **5 days** to make progress before it is automatically unassigned
- You can only hold **5 issues** at a time across the repo

### Unassigning Yourself
If you can no longer work on an issue, comment `/unassign` to release it:
- This frees it up for other contributors immediately
- No hard feelings — we appreciate the honesty!

### Assignment Rules
- ✅ First person to comment `/assign` gets the issue
- ✅ Only **one contributor** can be assigned per issue at a time
- ✅ Maximum **5 issues** per contributor at once
- ⚠️ You will get a warning after **2 days** of no activity
- ⚠️ You will get a final warning after **4 days** of no activity
- ❌ Issue is automatically unassigned after **5 days** of no activity

### Inactivity Warnings
The bot will ping you if your assigned issue has no activity:
- **Day 2** — friendly reminder to update your progress
- **Day 4** — final warning, 24 hours left before unassignment
- **Day 5** — automatic unassignment, issue reopens for others

### Tips
- Leave a comment on your issue if you are stuck or need help — any comment resets the inactivity timer
- Link your PR to the issue using `Fixes #issue_number` in your PR description
- If you see an issue already assigned, please pick a different one

---

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/what-you-documented
```

### 2. Make your changes

- Keep changes focused — one issue per PR
- Test your changes in the browser (test file upload, export, and download)
- Make sure `bun run lint` passes
- Make sure `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes (no TypeScript errors)

### 3. Commit your changes

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: add aria-label to export button"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `refactor:` — code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests
- `style:` — formatting, whitespace changes
- `chore:` — build config, dependencies

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch: `git push origin feat/your-feature-name`
2. Go to your fork on GitHub and click **"Compare & pull request"**
3. Fill in the PR template:
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Reference the issue: `Closes #<issue-number>`
   - **Attach a screen recording** (required for UI/feature changes — see below)
4. Submit the PR — maintainers will review within a few days

### Screen Recording Requirement

**Any PR that adds or modifies a UI element, a user-facing feature, or any visual behaviour must include a screen recording of the working change running on your local machine.**

This is a hard requirement — PRs without a recording will not be merged until one is added.

**What to record:**
- Run `bun run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`
- Demonstrate the full working flow of your change (e.g. upload a video → use the new control → export → see the result)
- Show any edge cases your implementation handles (empty state, error state, etc.)

**How to record:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd + Shift + 5` → Record Selected Portion, or use QuickTime Player
- **Windows**: `Win + G` → Xbox Game Bar → Capture
- **Linux**: OBS Studio, GNOME Screenshot tool, or `kazam`
- **Any OS**: [Loom](https://loom.com) (free, great for sharing)

Attach the recording directly to the PR by dragging the file into the GitHub comment box, or paste a Loom/shareable link.

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code works in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [ ] No new TypeScript errors (`bunx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] ESLint passes (`bun run lint`)
- [ ] UI changes tested on mobile (use browser DevTools)
- [ ] Accessibility: new interactive elements have ARIA labels
- [ ] Issue number referenced in PR description
- [ ] **Screen recording attached** (required for all UI/feature PRs)

---

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict types, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- **React**: Functional components only, use hooks
- **Tailwind**: Use utility classes; avoid inline `style={}` for static styles
- **No comments**: Code should be self-documenting via good naming; only add comments for non-obvious behavior
- **No console.log**: Remove debug logs before submitting
- **Imports**: Use relative imports within `src/`

---

## Development Tips

- **Fast Refresh**: Changes to React components update instantly without losing state
- **FFmpeg changes**: Changes to `src/lib/ffmpeg.ts` may require a full page reload
- **Testing exports**: Keep a few small test videos (~5-10 MB) for quick export testing
- **React DevTools**: Install the [React DevTools browser extension](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) for component inspection
- **Network throttling**: Use Chrome DevTools Network tab → "Slow 3G" to test FFmpeg download behavior
- **Mobile testing**: Chrome DevTools → Device Toolbar to test responsive layouts
- **Accessibility testing**: Use [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) browser extension
