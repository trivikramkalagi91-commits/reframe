Reframe is a **browser-based video editor** — everything happens on your device. Your videos are never sent to any server. No account needed. No fees. Just open and edit.

> Built for everyone — whether you're a creator resizing videos for social media, or just someone who wants to quickly trim and convert without installing bulky software.

## Features

- **Instant Resizing** — 11 preset formats (Reels, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) + custom dimensions
- **Flexible Framing** — Fit (letterbox) or Fill (crop) to your target aspect ratio
- **Precise Trimming** — Cut start and end times with real-time duration validation
- **Rotation** — 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotation support
- **Audio Control** — Keep or mute audio independently
- **Speed Control** — 0.25x to 4x playback speed with smooth audio adjustment
- **Quality Settings** — CRF slider for quality vs. file size trade-offs
- **Smooth UX** — Lottie animations, live export progress, instant download

Everything stays on your device. No servers. No tracking. No login.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter | Export video |
| Space | Play/pause video preview |
| M | Toggle audio mute |
| Escape | Cancel export |

> On macOS, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl` for keyboard shortcuts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 18+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magic-peach/reframe.git
cd reframe
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — component changes reflect instantly with [Next.js Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh), so you usually do not need to restart the dev server. For FFmpeg reload notes and debugging tools, see the [Development Tips](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-tips).

### Production Build

```bash
bun run build
```

Outputs a static site to `out/` — deploy to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

---

## Deploying

Reframe uses static export (`output: 'export'`), so it can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

### Deploying to Vercel

Reframe uses static export (`output: 'export'`) and can be deployed easily on Vercel.

#### Option 1 — Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
3. Import your forked repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `bun run build`
   - Output Directory: `out`
5. Click **Deploy**

Vercel will automatically build and host the static output.

#### Option 2 — Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

#### FFmpeg.wasm Configuration

FFmpeg.wasm requires COOP/COEP headers for SharedArrayBuffer support.

Add the following to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
          "value": "same-origin"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy",
          "value": "require-corp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alternative Static Hosts

You can also deploy Reframe on other static hosting providers:

| Platform             | Deployment Method                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Netlify**          | Connect your fork at https://app.netlify.com/start          |
| **GitHub Pages**     | Deploy the generated `out/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Connect your fork in Cloudflare Pages                       |

### Deploying to Vercel

The quickest way to get Reframe live:

**Option 1 — Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import your fork
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings:
   - **Framework Preset:** Next.js
   - **Build Command:** `bun run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `out`
4. Click **Deploy** — your site will be live in ~2 minutes

**Option 2 — Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

> **Note:** FFmpeg.wasm requires COOP/COEP headers for SharedArrayBuffer support. On Vercel, add a `vercel.json` in your project root:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "headers": [
>     {
>       "source": "/(.*)",
>       "headers": [
>         { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" },
>         { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }
>       ]
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```

### Deploying to Netlify

1. Push your fork to GitHub
2. Open Netlify and import the repository
3. Configure:
   - Build command: `bun run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
4. Deploy the site

> Note: FFmpeg browser features may require proper CORS headers depending on hosting setup.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

Build the static export:

```bash
bun run build
```

The production files will be generated in the `out/` directory.

You can deploy the `out/` folder using:
- GitHub Pages
- `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Actions workflow

## Architecture

For detailed technical information about Reframe's architecture, design choices, and implementation details, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

> Reframe requires WebAssembly (WASM) support to process videos in the browser.
---

## Development Tips

### 1. Next.js Fast Refresh
This project uses Next.js Fast Refresh in development mode. Most changes to React components, hooks, and styles are reflected instantly in the browser without restarting the dev server.

- Component updates appear immediately
- State is often preserved during edits
- Restarting `npm run dev` is usually unnecessary for UI changes

Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh

---

### 2. FFmpeg Module Changes
Changes to `ffmpeg.ts` may not hot-reload correctly because FFmpeg initialization and WebAssembly modules can persist in memory.

If updates are not reflected:

- Perform a full browser page reload
- Clear cached worker instances if necessary
- Restart the development server only when required

FFmpeg WASM reference: https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/overview

---

### 3. Monitor FFmpeg Downloads
FFmpeg WebAssembly assets can be large and may take time to download during development.

Use the browser DevTools **Network** tab to:

- Verify FFmpeg assets are loading correctly
- Inspect caching behavior
- Detect failed `.wasm` or worker requests
- Measure initialization performance

Chrome DevTools: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network

---

### 4. Use React DevTools
Install React DevTools for easier component inspection and debugging.

Helpful for:

- Inspecting component props and state
- Tracing re-renders
- Debugging hooks
- Monitoring React component trees

React DevTools: https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools

---

### 5. Keep Console Open During Development
The browser console provides important runtime diagnostics for:

- FFmpeg initialization issues
- Hydration warnings
- API request failures
- WebAssembly loading errors

Filtering logs by warnings/errors can speed up debugging significantly.

---

### 6. Use Source Maps for Easier Debugging
Development builds include source maps, allowing you to debug original TypeScript/React source files directly from DevTools.

Tips:

- Set breakpoints in source files
- Use async stack traces
- Inspect runtime variables during rendering

JavaScript debugging guide: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript

---

### 7. Watch for Memory Usage
FFmpeg WebAssembly processing can consume significant browser memory during video operations.

Recommendations:

- Close unused tabs while testing
- Refresh the page after heavy processing tasks
- Monitor memory usage in browser performance tools

Performance tools: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance

---

### 8. Verify Environment Variables
After modifying `.env.local`, restart the Next.js development server because environment variables are loaded only during server startup.

Example:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Environment variables guide: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables
